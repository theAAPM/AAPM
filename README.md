# AAPM
We provide partial data examples in the subfolder example_data(partial)
The complete attributes&categories are listed in attribute_based_labels.csv
Partial code of the databoost methods mentioned in the paper in subfolder databoost
More details will be announced after accepted.


With the constraint of different attributes, the input video can be classified into different
categories with the required attributes. Our AAPM adaptively learns attributes information based
on the input data, and provides different prototype representations.

# Adaptive Attribute-based Prototype Modeling (AAPM)

Welcome to the AAPM project repository! This project aims to classify input videos into different categories based on adaptive learning of attribute information.

## Overview

We provide partial data examples in the `example_data(partial)` subfolder. The complete attributes and categories can be found in `attribute_based_labels.csv`. Additionally, partial implementations of the databoost methods mentioned in our paper are available in the `databoost` subfolder.

More details will be announced after acceptance.

## Features

- Adaptive learning of attributes for video classification
- Provision of different prototype representations
