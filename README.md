# Adaptive Attribute-based Prototype Modeling (AAPM)

Welcome to the AAPM project repository! This project aims to classify input videos into different categories based on adaptive learning of attribute information.

## Overview

We provide partial data examples in the `example_data(partial)` subfolder. The complete attributes and categories can be found in `attribute_based_labels.csv`. Additionally, partial implementations of the databoost methods mentioned in our paper are available in the `databoost` subfolder.

More details will be announced after acceptance.
